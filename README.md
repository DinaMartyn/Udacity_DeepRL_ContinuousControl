# Udacity_DeepRL_ContinuousControl

Implementation of the second project at the Deep Q-learning to the Unity ML-Agent. Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

## Project Details



## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the DRLND GitHub repository to set up the Python environment [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). 

Additionally, install PyTorch (the project utilized PyTorch ver 0.4.0). 

## Instructions

Run sections 1-3 on the `Navigation.ipynb` in order to observe the performance of the random policy of the agent.

Run the rest of the `Navigation.ipynb` in order to train the agent and observe the performance of the smart agent.
